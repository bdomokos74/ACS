This contains some of the codes developed in book 1.

We choose new names for the integrator: "evolve_variable_timestep".
When we write simpler or more complex versions we can use this nomenclature:

  evolve_constant_timestep
  evolve_variable_timestep
  evolve_individual_timestep
  evolve_partial_force  (for generalized Ahmed-Cohen schemes),
  . . .

We also choose a new name for the code that builds a Plummer model,
simply "plummer".  Later we can provide a library function with a
creator for a Plummer model, called "plummer()".  For a Plummer
realization with 100 particles, say, we could then call "plummer(100)",
while the default "plummer()" might provide the analytical expression
of the potential-density pair instead (as a printout, or in other symbolic
form; for now, the best default would probably be just an error message).
