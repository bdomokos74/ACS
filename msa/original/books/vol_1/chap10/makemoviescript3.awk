# makemoviescript2.awk
#
# This awk script takes a list of filenames, each containing one N-body
# snapshot.  The files are produced by the awk script split_snapshot1.awk
# from an N-body snapshot stream.  Commands are then generated for gnuplot
# to show a movie, at a rate of one frame per second, where successive
# frames show successive snapshots.
#
# usage: this script is not intended to be used standalone.
# instead, use "makemovie.csh" which invokes this script.
