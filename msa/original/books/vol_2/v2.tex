% comment out the following line if you want to latex the whole book:
%\includeonly{ch9}
  \input{pream.tex}
\begin{document}
  \frontmatter
\makebox[3.5in][s]{}\verb=Time-stamp: <2002-05-14 13:16:39 piet>=
%
% nice latex feature: you can specify which files you want to include in your
% next output, by listing only those files as arguments to \includeonly{} 
% above on the third line (I had to put this comment here, since the emacs
% time stamp is only recognized in the first eight lines).
% NOTE: if you want to print out the whole book, simply comment out the line
% starting with \includeonly above.
%
% It is a good idea to write this top level file out, each time a change has
% been made, in order to get the correct time stamp to appear on the title
% page.  Even if you print out only one chapter, still the title page will
% appear, so that the time stamp will be include (otherwise the time stamp
% would appear uselessly on a separate white page, before the chapter).
%
    \input{def}           % input, not include, since all files need the \def{}
    \input{title}         % input, in order to let the time stamp appear
%
% uncomment the following three lines, if you want to print two pages
% on one, using e.g. "psnup -2 v1.ps > v1_2.ps".  Normally the next three
% lines should be commented out, but in that case psnup will print the right
% (left) pages on the left (right) side.

% history:
%
% May 2001: ph and jm met in New York, where they wrote code and produced
%           pictures for the two-body problem.
%
% July 2001: ph and jm met in Tokyo, where they wrote code and produced
%            pictures for the figure-8 three-body problem.
%
% Nov. 2001: ph and jm met in New York, where they discussed how to structure
%            the first three volumes.  Following their meeting, ph started to
%            write draft text for the first part of volume 1.
%
% Dec. 2001: ph started to add introductory text in preface and early chapters
%            and ph and jm began to experiment with joint code development and
%            text writing across the internet
