The aim of our series is to provide a student with a hands-on guide to
building a computational laboratory, and doing state-of-the-art
research with it. The series will be self-contained: a high-school
student should be able to start at page 1, and work her way through
the series.  <a href=manifesto.html> [more . . .]</a>
<p>
The central aim of our book series is to break down the barrier
between research and education.  From an educational point of view,
our approach is unusual in that we aim to lead a student along the
shortest path from an elementary introduction to the cutting edge of
research.  At the same time, the reverse is true as well: from a
research point of view, we want to illustrate how extensive
documentation is beneficial for a research project.

We have coined the term <i> Variational Programming</i> to describe our
prefered approach to programming: to follow a path of least action.
The name is borrow from physics, where Hamilton's variational
principle states that a physical trajectory of a particle is given by
a path along which the action is minimal.

<p>
Our main goal in this series is to
propose a new approach to both research and education in computational
science, bringing out all aspects: letting the science, the arts and
the crafts aspects of research all be present in the educational offering.
We expect that here will be others who share our enthusiasm, after seeing
what we have begun.
