<p>


The aim of our series is to provide a student with a hands-on guide to
building a computational laboratory, and doing state-of-the-art
research with it.  The series will be self-contained: a high-school
student should be able to start at page 1, and work her way through
the series.
<p>
It may seem like a tall order, to use a series of books to lead a
student through a process that normally takes five years, from
entering college to being able to do research as a graduate student.
What we offer here is a shortcut, not a replacement of a traditional
curriculum.  A motivated high school student or undergraduate could
set aside a summer for self-study, or even better, pair up with
another student, to start working through this book series.  That way,
the would quickly get a taste for conducting real independent research.
Having acquired the taste and experience will be invaluable for them,
no matter what speciality they would choose in the end.
<p>
The problem with the hundreds of introductory text books to science is
that they mostly provide summaries, highly distilled collections of
knowledge that can only be internalized through a process of hands-on
experience that is generally left out.  Even when detailed exercises
are given, together with their solutions, this still leaves out the
actual experience of anybody trying to solve a problem, and getting
hopelessly astray.  Research is (much) more than 90\% about making
mistakes, and (much) less than 10\% about finding something new and
original.  Educational learning is no different.  We all learn from
solving excercises, not by the answer we get, but by learning what not
to do wrong in the process.
<p>
Of course, there is a good reason that text books are presented in the
style they are presented.  Giving the reader a real-life impression of
all (or at least much) that can go wrong in solving problems would
expand the size of a book by a factor of ten, if not more.  Therefore,
it is certainly a good thing that most text books are as they are,
providing reference material for a course, and providing the kernel of
knowledge for gifted or already somewhat experienced students who are
brave enough to try to learn the material on their own.
<p>
However, we think there is room for a different approach, one that has
not been attempted earlier, as far as we know.  We will try to follow
a few individual students, getting occasional guidance from a teacher,
in the actual process of learning through trial and error.  This
choice dictates the format as that of a dialogue, in which we can
overhear what goes wrong, and how the students sooner or later find
out how to correct their errors and misunderstandings.
<p>
Still, we are faced with the problem of cramming five years of student
experience in only ten volumes.  Our solution has been to take as
simple a problem we could think of within science.  In fact it is the
oldest unsolved problem ever since the day Newton formulated
mathematical physics, as the basis of modern science.  It is the
gravitional many-body problem, in which a collection of celestial
bodies move under the influence of their mutual gravitational
interactions.
<p>
An example of the two-body problem is the motion of the Moon around
the Earth, or that of the Earth around the Sun.  An example of the
three-body problem is that of the Earth, Moon, and Sun now taken
together, with the perturbations of the Sun taking into account in
following the Moon on its way around the earth.  The Sun and the major
planets, from Mercury to Neptune, offers an example of a nine-body
problem.  A rich star cluster, such as M15 or 47 Tuc, provides an
example of a million-body problem.  And our whole galaxy, as well as
our neighbor the Andromeda galaxy, can be modeled as a
multi-billion-body gravitational problem.
<p>
Having selected a problem that can be explained relatively easily, we
plan to introduce the notion of a physical force, the notion of a
gravitational force, the idea of a differential equation, as well as
the concept of numerical approximations to its solution.  This will
all appear in Volume 1.  Hands-on experience in simulating the dance
of three bodies will be the topic of Volume 2, while the study of a
25-body system, as a model for a star cluster, will occupy Volume 3.
<p>
The current manuscript (which will be provided here within a few
weeks) provides a first draft for these three volumes
combined, but as yet without the most introductory steps; we hope to
provide those soon(ish), at least within the next few years.
<p>
Volume 4 will take a pause from learning physics and numerical analysis,
and instead will focus on computer science: how to build robust modules 
that are flexible enough to function as tools in a growing toolbox that
can used to build your own software environment tailered to the type of
scientific simulations you would like to perform.
<p>
Volume 5 will pick up the science quest, to show how to begin to build a
state-of-the-art $N$-body code (for historical reasons, the gravitional
many-body problem is often callded the $N$-body problem).
<p>
Volume 6 will continue this quest, by showing how such a code can be
made to deal with the challenge of following close encounters, as well
as tight double stars.
<p>
Volume 7 will wrap us the quest, by introducing a way to handle even
collisions between stars, through simple forms of hydrodynamics and
stellar evolution.
<p>
Volumes 8, 9, and 10 will use the tools and the software environment
established in Volumes 4 through 7 to start doing actual research,
while continuing to build additional tools.
<p>
This, at least, is our current plan.  We have no idea whether we can
finish this series in the ten years we plan to work on it, or whether
it will take longer, but we'll give it a try.  We may also chance the
projected volume numbering, if we find a good reason to do so, but at
least for now, the numbering presented above seems to make most sense.
